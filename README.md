# CryptoKey
CryptoKey is an encapsulation for cryptographic keys in Go that makes
cryptographic agility support simple for Go applications.  

CryptoKey uses [Coze](https://github.com/Cyphrme/Coze/blob/135a89c8e742c57234820826a8dd0971b28a6a45/README.md#alg-parameters)'s `alg` for denoting keys which allows CryptoKey to simplify
the interface for interacting with various keys. 

# Dev
## Go Mod
To import Coze, Go needs the lower case string for `go get`

```
go get
```
